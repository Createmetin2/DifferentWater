There is already a similar system on metin2dev,
(https://metin2.dev/board/topic/68-how-to-get-different-watertypes/)
but it was a bit inconvenient, since you had to change every setting.txt. This new version is no longer needed.

-If the map has no WaterType then set the normal water texture.
-If the map has the WaterType then look for the folder called "water_x" where x means the type entered in the watertype.

It is possible to use watertype 0. Negative values are not allowed.

255 water textures can be inserted.
